# Refactor the e-commerce store in Vue.js

# Peoject Overview
The aim of this project is to re-build the e-commerce store using Vue.js, utilizing the built e-commerce store in react.js.

The project was built using the Vue template using vite thus to run the project you will first need to install the node modules running npm install. Then you can run the code using npm run dev.

# Tech Stack 
* HTML
* CSS Tailwind
* JavaScript
* Vue.js

# Content
* Home Page
* Filter and Sort buttons
* Product List with cards of individual products
* A page that displays product details.

# Usage 
The website is an e-commerce store which users can browse for different products from different categories.

* The home page which displays the product list displays all the products in cards in default sorting.
* The website contains a filter dropdown and the sort options.
* When the filter option for a category is selected a new api call is made to get new data for products of that specific category.
* The user can than sort the data based on price from low to high and high to low.
* The user can then see more details about the product by clicking a product card to go to another page which will display the product details.

# Area of mastery
Working with Vue.js, the different ways to handle data compared to React.js and Alpine.js, how to structure components in Vue, as it differs from React.js using script tags, style tags and straight html nested inside a template tag, although I decided to use tailwind which rendered style tags unnecessary. The usage of pinia for state management, the usage of ref for reactivity, The usage of v-if and v-else for directives, Understood more of lifecycles such as using onMount. Then there was Routing which for my vue project I used vue-router which works slighlty similar to react-routers without the need for importing useParam.

# Project Process

# Challenges
The biggest challenge I had with this project was working it params which took me a long time to work around, luckily with the help of some goggle I kept referring back to it solve with some breaking and rebuilding. I also had a tough time refactoring the store from Svelte to Vue, which took me a lot longer to fix and have functional than I thought. I also had a tough time dealing with maintaining the state of my filter and sort when toggling between different pages.

# Feedback
This was a great introduction to another different JavaScript framework different from React.js, Alpine.js and Svelte.js . The project was diverse but thanks to the reference project and the knowledge of React.js, Svelte.js and JavaScript, this was fun to work on. I found alot of familiarity between Vue, Svelte and React, more specifically the usage of routes and how we use components.
